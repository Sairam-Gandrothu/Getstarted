# ğŸ‘‹ Hello, GitHub!

I just started my journey on GitHub ğŸš€  

This is my very first repository, and Iâ€™m exploring how things work here.  
Expect some experiments, small projects, and plenty of learning along the way.  

## About me
- ğŸŒ± Currently learning how to use Git and GitHub  
- ğŸ’¡ Interested in coding, sharing projects, and improving my skills  
- ğŸ“Œ This repo is mainly a sandbox to get started  

## Whatâ€™s next?
Iâ€™ll be adding more meaningful projects soon as I get more comfortable here.  
Stay tuned!
